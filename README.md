# Loop-Optimization-in-Source-Code
ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This mini-project focuses on Loop Optimization, a crucial compiler optimization technique that enhances the efficiency and performance of source code by improving loop execution. Loop optimization aims to minimize redundant computations, reduce runtime overhead, and maximize hardware utilization â€” ultimately contributing to faster and more efficient program execution.

This project aligns with United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) No. 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure, promoting innovation and efficiency in computing and software engineering.

ðŸ§© Description

In compiler design, loops often represent a major portion of execution time in programs. Optimizing these loops can significantly improve performance.
This project demonstrates how loop optimization techniques such as:

Loop Invariant Code Motion

Strength Reduction

Dead Code Elimination

Loop Unrolling


can enhance the overall efficiency of a program without changing its output.

âš™ Features

Implements multiple loop optimization algorithms.

Provides performance comparison before and after optimization.

Clean and modular source code written for readability.

Demonstrates compiler design principles in practice.

Lightweight and easy to run in VS Code or any compiler environment.
